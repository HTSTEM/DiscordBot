# HTSTEM's Discord Bots

## HTSTEM-Bote
Script file: `htstem_bote_wrapper.py`
Arguments: `--testing/-t` Switches out all the discord IDs to ones for testing. This should not be used for running the bot
Requirements: `feedparser`, `discord.py`
Files required: `bot-token.txt` (will use first line as token and ignore all other lines)
Notes: Uses `videoURLS.txt` in the same directory as the script. This is automatically created by the script when not detected.

## Joinbot
Script file: `logbot.py`
Arguments: `None`
Requirements: `discord.py`
Files required: `bot-token.txt` (will use first and second line as tokens and ignore all other lines)
Notes: Creates folders called `bot-1` and sometimes `bot-2` which store user message counts. Folder structure: `./bot-<bot_number>/<server_id>/<month>/` containing files `<user_id>.txt` where the first line is the message count and the second line is the user's name.
