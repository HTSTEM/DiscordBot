HTSTEM-Bote:
---
Script file: `main.py`
Arguments: `None`
Requirements: `feedparser, discord.py`
Files required: `bot-token.txt` (will use first line as token and ignore all other lines)

---
Script file: `logbot.py`
Arguments: `None`
Requirements: `discord.py`
Files required: `bot-token.txt` (will use first and second line as tokens and ignore all other lines)
